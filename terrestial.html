			<h4>American Bison</h4>
				<img src="https://lwos.life/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Bison.v1.jpg" alt="" style="width:400px; height:400px">
				<p>The American bison (Bison bison), is an American species of bison that once roamed North America in vast herds. Bison are often called buffalo, though this term is also used to refer to other bovines. It is one of two extant species of bison, alongside the European bison. Its historical range, by 9000 BC, is described as the great bison belt, a tract of rich grassland that ran from Alaska to the Gulf of Mexico, east to the Atlantic Seaboard (nearly to the Atlantic tidewater in some areas) as far north as New York and south to Georgia and, according to some sources, further south to Florida, with sightings in North Carolina near Buffalo Ford on the Catawba River as late as 1750.[2][3][4] It nearly became extinct by a combination of commercial hunting and slaughter in the 19th century and introduction of bovine diseases from domestic cattle. With a population in excess of 60 million in the late 18th century, the species was down to just 541 animals by 1889. Recovery efforts expanded in the mid-20th century, with a resurgence to roughly 31,000[5] wild bison today, largely restricted to a few national parks and reserves. Through multiple reintroductions, the species is now also freely roaming wild in some regions in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, with it also being introduced to Yakutia in Russia.</p>
			<h4>Elk</h4>
				<img src="https://www.hcn.org/articles/wildlife-hiking-trails-are-a-path-to-destruction-for-colorado-elk-vail/rockymtnelk-png/@@images/7ba85e61-d3d0-4992-9d12-3c5d8f2d98f5.png" alt="Elk" style="width:400px; height:400px;">
				<p>The elk (Cervus canadensis), also known as the wapiti, is one of the largest species within the deer family, Cervidae, and one of the largest terrestrial mammals in its native range of North America, as well as Central and East Asia. It is often confused with the larger Alces alces, which is called moose in North America, but called elk in British English, and related names in other European languages (German Elch, Swedish älg, French élan). The name "wapiti" is sometimes used in North America for Cervus canadensis. It originates from the Shawnee and Cree word waapiti, meaning 'white rump'.<br></br>Elk range in forest and forest-edge habitat, feeding on grasses, plants, leaves, and bark. Male elk have large antlers which they shed each year. Males also engage in ritualized mating behaviors during the rut, including posturing, antler wrestling (sparring), and bugling, a loud series of vocalizations that establishes dominance over other males and attracts females. Although it is currently native to North America and central/eastern Asia, it had a much wider distribution in the past. Populations were present across Eurasia into Western Europe during the Late Pleistocene and survived into the early Holocene in southern Sweden and the Alps; the extinct Merriam's elk subspecies ranged into Mexico. The elk has adapted well to countries where it has been introduced, including Argentina and New Zealand. Its adaptability may in fact threaten endemic species and the ecosystems into which it has been introduced.</p>
			<h4>White-tailed Deer</h4>
				<img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/40/109040-050-62EEDEA6/Male-white-tailed-deer.jpg?w=400&h=300&c=crop" alt="White-tailed Deer" style="width:400px; height:400px;">
				<p>The white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), also known as the whitetail or Virginia deer, is a medium-sized deer native to North America, Central America, Ecuador, and South America as far south as Peru and Bolivia.[2] It has also been introduced to New Zealand, all the Greater Antilles in the Caribbean (Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, and Puerto Rico[3]), and some countries in Europe, such as the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Romania and Serbia.[4][5] In the Americas, it is the most widely distributed wild ungulate.<br></br>In North America, the species is widely distributed east of the Rocky Mountains as well as in southwestern Arizona and most of Mexico, except Lower California. It is mostly displaced by the black-tailed or mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) from that point west except for mixed deciduous riparian corridors, river valley bottomlands, and lower foothills of the northern Rocky Mountain region from Wyoming west to eastern Washington and eastern Oregon and north to northeastern British Columbia and southern Yukon, including in the Montana valley and foothill grasslands. The westernmost population of the species, known as the Columbian white-tailed deer, was once widespread in the mixed forests along the Willamette and Cowlitz River valleys of western Oregon and southwestern Washington, but current numbers are considerably reduced, and it is classified as near-threatened. This population is separated from other white-tailed deer populations.</p>
			<h4>Wild Boar</h4>
				<img src="https://www.treehugger.com/thmb/puIthSI6-uk4P3S4GTdpPWPfqjs=/1732x1299/smart/filters:no_upscale()/GettyImages-1194062139-0ff404cdd7414f648f48ff61b4a32d0c.jpg" alt="Wild Boar" style="width:400px; height:400px;">
				<p>The wild boar (Sus scrofa), also known as the wild swine,[3] common wild pig,[4] Eurasian wild pig,[5] or simply wild pig,[6] is a suid native to much of Eurasia and North Africa, and has been introduced to the Americas and Oceania. The species is now one of the widest-ranging mammals in the world, as well as the most widespread suiform.[4] It has been assessed as least concern on the IUCN Red List due to its wide range, high numbers, and adaptability to a diversity of habitats.[1] It has become an invasive species in part of its introduced range. Wild boars probably originated in Southeast Asia during the Early Pleistocene[7] and outcompeted other suid species as they spread throughout the Old World.[8]<br></br>As of 1990, up to 16 subspecies are recognized, which are divided into four regional groupings based on skull height and lacrimal bone length.[2] The species lives in matriarchal societies consisting of interrelated females and their young (both male and female). Fully grown males are usually solitary outside the breeding season.[9] The grey wolf is the wild boar's main predator in most of its natural range except in the Far East and the Lesser Sunda Islands, where it is replaced by the tiger and Komodo dragon respectively.[10][11] The wild boar has a long history of association with humans, having been the ancestor of most domestic pig breeds and a big-game animal for millennia. Boars have also re-hybridized in recent decades with feral pigs; these boar–pig hybrids have become a serious pest wild animal in the Americas and Australia.</p>

		<div class="Carnivorans">
			<h4>Coyote</h4>
				<img src="https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/11/46/65/19295575/4/ratio3x2_1800.jpg" alt="Coyote" style="width:400px; height:400px;">
				<p>The coyote (Canis latrans) is a species of canine native to North America. It is smaller than its close relative, the wolf, and slightly smaller than the closely related eastern wolf and red wolf. It fills much of the same ecological niche as the golden jackal does in Eurasia. The coyote is larger and more predatory and was once referred to as the American jackal by a behavioral ecologist. Other historical names for the species include the prairie wolf and the brush wolf.<br></br>The coyote is listed as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, due to its wide distribution and abundance throughout North America. Coyote populations are also abundant southwards through Mexico and into Central America. The species is versatile, able to adapt to and expand into environments modified by humans. It is enlarging its range by moving into urban areas in the eastern U.S. and Canada. The coyote was sighted in eastern Panama (across the Panama Canal from their home range) for the first time in 2013.</p>
			<h4>Gray Wolf</h4>
				<img src="https://www.ecowatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/45144063-origin.jpg" alt="Gray wolf" style="width:400px; height:400px;">
				<p>The wolf (Canis lupus[b]), also known as the gray wolf or grey wolf, is a large canine native to Eurasia and North America. More than thirty subspecies of Canis lupus have been recognized, and gray wolves, as popularly understood, comprise non-domestic/feral subspecies. The wolf is the largest extant member of the family Canidae. It is also distinguished from other Canis species by its less pointed ears and muzzle, as well as a shorter torso and a longer tail. The wolf is nonetheless related closely enough to smaller Canis species, such as the coyote and the golden jackal, to produce fertile hybrids with them. The banded fur of a wolf is usually mottled white, brown, gray, and black, although subspecies in the arctic region may be nearly all white.<br></br>Of all members of the genus Canis, the wolf is most specialized for cooperative game hunting as demonstrated by its physical adaptations to tackling large prey, its more social nature, and its highly advanced expressive behaviour including individual or group howling. It travels in nuclear families consisting of a mated pair accompanied by their offspring. Offspring may leave to form their own packs on the onset of sexual maturity and in response to competition for food within the pack. Wolves are also territorial and fights over territory are among the principal causes of wolf mortality. The wolf is mainly a carnivore and feeds on large wild hooved mammals as well as smaller animals, livestock, carrion, and garbage. Single wolves or mated pairs typically have higher success rates in hunting than do large packs. Pathogens and parasites, notably rabies virus, may infect wolves</p>
			<h4>Red Wolf</h4>
				<img src="https://preview.redd.it/tcgmgha90bs21.jpg?auto=webp&s=89909557131d53f9a1e6c26a91ca8f72ba5da9fd" alt="Red wolf" style="width:400px; height:400px;">
				<p>The red wolf (Canis rufus) is a canine native to the southeastern United States. Its size is intermediate between the coyote (Canis latrans) and gray wolf (Canis lupus).</p>
			<h4>North American River Otter</h4>
				<img src="https://www.americanrivers.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/36416802923_f2a4c89a1d_b-1024x675.jpeg" alt="North American River Otter" style="width:400px; height:400px;">
				<p>The North American river otter (Lontra canadensis), also known as the northern river otter and river otter, is a semiaquatic mammal that only lives on the North American continent, along its waterways and coasts. An adult North American river otter can weigh between 5.0 and 14 kg (11.0 and 30.9 lb). The river otter is protected and insulated by a thick, water-repellent coat of fur.<br></br>The North American river otter, a member of the subfamily Lutrinae in the weasel family (Mustelidae), is equally versatile in the water and on land. It establishes a burrow close to the water's edge in river, lake, swamp, coastal shoreline, tidal flat, or estuary ecosystems. The den typically has many tunnel openings, one of which generally allows the otter to enter and exit the body of water. Female North American river otters give birth in these burrows, producing litters of one to six young.<br></br>North American river otters, like most predators, prey upon the most readily accessible species. Fish is a favored food among the otters, but they also consume various amphibians (such as salamanders and frogs), freshwater clams, mussels, snails, small turtles and crayfish. The most common fish consumed are perch, suckers, and catfish. Occasional reports also show the river otter eating other small animals, such as mice, squirrels, birds, and even dogs that they've attacked and drowned</p>
			<h4>Bobcat</h4>
				<img src="https://www.treehugger.com/thmb/FsoA7bvK3JfOzaZCJmW0HTEXjRY=/2121x1414/filters:fill(auto,1)/bobcat-in-the-snow-1203030300-244f206d3b7c4e4ebe9ade0f3e41ea0d.jpg" alt="Bobcat" style="width:400px; height:400px;">
				<p>The bobcat (Lynx rufus), also known as the red lynx, is a medium-sized cat native to North America. It ranges from southern Canada through most of the contiguous United States to Oaxaca in Mexico. It is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List since 2002, due to its wide distribution and large population. Although it has been hunted extensively both for sport and fur, populations have proven stable, though declining in some areas.<br></br>It has distinctive black bars on its forelegs and a black-tipped, stubby (or "bobbed") tail, from which it derives its name. It reaches a body length of up to 125 cm (50 in). It is an adaptable predator inhabiting wooded areas, semidesert, urban edge, forest edge, and swampland environments. It remains in some of its original range, but populations are vulnerable to extirpation by coyotes and domestic animals. Though the bobcat prefers rabbits and hares, it hunts insects, chickens, geese and other birds, small rodents, and deer. Prey selection depends on location and habitat, season, and abundance. Like most cats, the bobcat is territorial and largely solitary, although with some overlap in home ranges. It uses several methods to mark its territorial boundaries, including claw marks and deposits of urine or feces. The bobcat breeds from winter into spring and has a gestation period of about two months</p>
			<h4>Striped Skink</h4>
				<img src="https://nationalzoo.si.edu/sites/default/files/animals/stripedskunk-003.jpg" alt="Striped Skunk" style="width:400px; height:400px;">
				<p>The striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis) is a skunk of the genus Mephitis that occurs across much of North America, including southern Canada, the United States, and northern Mexico. It is currently listed as least concern by the IUCN on account of its wide range and ability to adapt to human-modified environments.<br></br>Striped skunks are polygamous omnivores with few natural predators, save for birds of prey.[2] Like all skunks, they possess highly developed musk-filled scent glands to ward off predators. They have a long history of association with humans, having been trapped and captively bred for their fur[4] and kept as pets.[5] The striped skunk is one of the most recognizable of North America's animals, and is a popular figure in cartoons and children's books</p>
			<h4>Eastern Spotted Skunk</h4>
				<img src="https://wisconsinww.files.wordpress.com/2020/10/spotted-skunk.jpg?w=479" alt="Eastern Spotted Skunk" style="width:400px; height:400px;">
				<p>The eastern spotted skunk (Spilogale putorius) is a small, relatively slender skunk found in North America, throughout the eastern United States and in small areas of Canada and Mexico.<br></br>This small skunk is more weasel-like in body shape than the more familiar striped skunk. The eastern spotted skunk has four stripes on its back[2] which are broken in pattern, giving it a "spotted" appearance. They have a white spot on their forehead. They are found in Canada (southeast Manitoba and northwestern Ontario), the United States and northeastern Mexico.[1] Males, at 46.3–68.8 cm (18.2–27.1 in) in total length, are larger than females, at 35–54.4 cm (13.8–21.4 in).[2] The tail accounts for roughly a third of their total length. Body mass can range from 0.2 to 1.8 kg (0.44 to 3.97 lb), with males averaging around 700 g (1.5 lb) against the female's average of 450 g (0.99 lb).[3] Skull length is 43–55 mm (1.7–2.2 in).[4] The eastern spotted skunk is a very small skunk, no larger than a good-sized tree squirrel</p>
			<h4>Least Weasel</h4>
				<img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/546d61b5e4b049f0b10b95c5/8a0eb171-bd2c-4127-be10-df79c344af57/LongTailed+Weasel.jpg" alt="Least Weasel" style="width:400px; height:400px;">
				<p>The least weasel (Mustela nivalis), little weasel, common weasel, or simply weasel is the smallest member of the genus Mustela, family Mustelidae and order Carnivora.[2] It is native to Eurasia, North America and North Africa, and has been introduced to New Zealand, Malta, Crete, the Azores, and São Tomé. It is classified as least concern by the IUCN, due to its wide distribution and large population throughout the Northern Hemisphere.<br></br>The least weasel varies greatly in size over its range. The body is slender and elongated, and the legs and tail are relatively short. The colour varies geographically, as does the pelage type and length of tail. The dorsal surface, flanks, limbs and tail of the animal are usually some shade of brown while the underparts are white. The line delineating the boundary between the two colours is usually straight. At high altitudes and in the northern part of its range, the coat becomes pure white in winter. Eighteen subspecies are recognised.</p>
			<h4>Long-tailed Weasel</h4>
				<img src="https://nhpbs.org/wild/images/longtailedweaselwikiKeithandKasia.jpg" alt="Long-tailed Weasel" style="width:400px; height:400px;">
				<p>The long-tailed weasel (Neogale frenata), also known as the bridled weasel, masked ermine, or big stoat, is a species of mustelid distributed from southern Canada throughout all the United States and Mexico, southward through all of Central America and into northern South America. It is distinct from the short-tailed weasel (Mustela erminea), also known as a "stoat", a close relation in the genus Mustela that originated in Eurasia and crossed into North America some half million years ago.</p>
			<h4>American Mink</h4>
				<img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/C0BA/production/_105483394_mink_get.jpg" alt="American Mink" style="width:400px; height:400px;">
				<p>The American mink (Neogale vison) is a semiaquatic species of mustelid native to North America, though human intervention has expanded its range to many parts of Europe, Asia and South America. Because of range expansion, the American mink is classed as a least-concern species by the IUCN.[1] The American mink was formerly thought to be the only extant member of the genus Neovison following the extinction of the sea mink (N. macrodon), but recent studies, followed by taxonomic authorities, have reclassified it and the sea mink within the genus Neogale, which also contains a few New World weasel species.[3] The American mink is a carnivore that feeds on rodents, fish, crustaceans, frogs, and birds. In its introduced range in Europe it has been classified as an invasive species linked to declines in European mink, Pyrenean desman, and water vole populations. It is the animal most frequently farmed for its fur, exceeding the silver fox, sable, marten, and skunk in economic importance</p>
			<h4>Fisher</h4>
				<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/Fisher_cat_tree.jpg" alt="Fisher" style="width:400px; height:400px;">
				<p>The fisher (Pekania pennanti) is a small, carnivorous mammal native to North America, a forest-dwelling creature whose range covers much of the boreal forest in Canada to the northern United States. It is a member of the mustelid family (commonly referred to as the weasel family), and is in the monospecific genus Pekania. It is sometimes misleadingly referred to as a fisher cat, although it is not a cat.</p>
			<h4>Raccoon</h4>
				<img src="https://extension.umd.edu/sites/extension.umd.edu/files/styles/optimized/public/2021-02/hgic_veg_wildlife_raccoon.jpg?itok=p4k_Z_CF" alt="Raccoon" style="width:400px; height:400px;">
				<p>The raccoon (/rəˈkuːn/ or US: /ræˈkuːn/ (audio speaker iconlisten), Procyon lotor), sometimes called the common raccoon to distinguish it from other species, is a medium-sized mammal native to North America. It is the largest of the procyonid family, having a body length of 40 to 70 cm (16 to 28 in), and a body weight of 5 to 26 kg (11 to 57 lb). Its grayish coat mostly consists of dense underfur, which insulates it against cold weather. Three of the raccoon's most distinctive features are its extremely dexterous front paws, its facial mask, and its ringed tail, which are themes in the mythologies of the indigenous peoples of the Americas relating to the animal. The raccoon is noted for its intelligence, as studies show that it is able to remember the solution to tasks for at least three years. It is usually nocturnal and omnivorous, eating about 40% invertebrates, 33% plants, and 27% vertebrates.<br></br>The original habitats of the raccoon are deciduous and mixed forests, but due to their adaptability, they have extended their range to mountainous areas, coastal marshes, and urban areas, where some homeowners consider them to be pests. As a result of escapes and deliberate introductions in the mid-20th century, raccoons are now also distributed across much of mainland Europe, the Caucasus, and Japan.</p>
			<h4>Cougar</h4>
				<img src="https://niteguard.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mtnlion.jpg" alt="Cougar" style="width:400px; height:400px;">
				<p>The cougar (Puma concolor) is a large cat of the subfamily Felinae. Native to the Americas, its range spans from the Canadian Yukon to the southern Andes in South America and is the most widespread of any large wild terrestrial mammal in the Western Hemisphere. It is an adaptable, generalist species, occurring in most American habitat types. Due to its wide range, it has many names, including puma, mountain lion, catamount, panther and painter.<br></br>The cougar is the second-largest cat in the New World after the jaguar (Panthera onca). Secretive and largely solitary by nature, the cougar is properly considered both nocturnal and crepuscular, although daytime sightings do occur. Despite its size, the cougar is more closely related to smaller felines, including the domestic cat (Felis catus) than to any species of the subfamily Pantherinae.<br></br>The cougar is an ambush predator that pursues a wide variety of prey. Primary food sources are ungulates, particularly deer, but it also hunts insects and rodents. It prefers habitats with dense underbrush and rocky areas for stalking, but also lives in open areas. The cougar is territorial and lives at low population densities. Individual home ranges depend on terrain, vegetation and abundance of prey. While large, it is not always the apex predator in its range, yielding prey it has killed to jaguars, American black bears, grizzly bears, packs of wolves or coyotes, and (in Florida) to American alligators. It is reclusive and mostly avoids people. Fatal attacks on humans are rare, but increased in North America as more people entered cougar habitat and built farms.</p>
			<h4>Gray Fox</h4>
				<img src="https://www.wildlifeillinois.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Gray-Fox.jpeg" alt="Gray Fox" style="width:400px; height:400px;">
				<p>The gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), or grey fox, is an omnivorous mammal of the family Canidae, widespread throughout North America and Central America. This species and its only congener, the diminutive island fox (Urocyon littoralis) of the California Channel Islands, are the only living members of the genus Urocyon, which is considered to be genetically basal to all other living canids. Its species name cinereoargenteus means "ashen silver".<br></br>It was once the most common fox in the eastern United States, and though still found there, human advancement and deforestation allowed the red fox to become the predominant fox-like canid. Despite this post-colonial competition, the gray fox has been able to thrive in urban and suburban environments. One of the best examples being southern Florida.[2][3] The Pacific States and Great Lakes region still have the gray fox as their prevalent fox</p>
			<h4>American Black Bear</h4>
				<img src="https://bear.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/20130607_Bow-copy.jpg" alt="American Black Bear" style="width:400px; height:400px;">
				<p>The American black bear (Ursus americanus) or simply black bear, is a medium-sized bear endemic to North America. It is the continent's smallest and most widely distributed bear species. American black bears are omnivores, with their diets varying greatly depending on season and location. They typically live in largely forested areas, but will leave forests in search of food, and are sometimes attracted to human communities due to the immediate availability of food. Despite the name, some subspecies can be brown or even blond in coloration</p>
			<h4>Red Fox</h4>
				<img src="https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/messagemedia.co/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/54/5547be48-ee2f-11e2-b5cb-0019bb30f31a/51e56bb0d88ad.image.jpg" alt="Red Fox" style="width:400px; height:400px;">
				<p>The red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is the largest of the true foxes and one of the most widely distributed members of the order Carnivora, being present across the entire Northern Hemisphere including most of North America, Europe and Asia, plus parts of North Africa. It is listed as least concern by the IUCN.[1] Its range has increased alongside human expansion, having been introduced to Australia, where it is considered harmful to native mammals and bird populations. Due to its presence in Australia, it is included on the list of the "world's 100 worst invasive species"</p>

			<h4>Star-nosed Mole</h4>
				<img src="https://www.sciencefriday.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cutemole.jpg" alt="Star-nosed Mole" style="width:400px; height:400px;">
				<p>The star-nosed mole (Condylura cristata) is a small mole found in moist, low areas in the northern parts of North America.[3] It is the only member of the tribe having a touch organ with more than 25,000 minute sensory receptors, known as Eimer's organs, with which this hamster-sized mole feels its way around. With the help of its Eimer's organs, it may be perfectly poised to detect seismic wave vibrations.[4]<br></br>The extremely sensitive star-like structure is covered with minute touch receptors known as Eimer's organs. The nose is about 1 cm in diameter with roughly 25,000 Eimer's organs distributed on 22 appendages.[5] Eimer's organs were first described in the European mole in 1871 by German zoologist Theodor Eimer. Other mole species also possess Eimer's organs, though they are not as specialized or numerous as in the star-nosed mole. Because the star-nosed mole is functionally blind, the snout was long suspected to be used to detect electrical activity in prey animals,[6] though little, if any, empirical support has been found for this hypothesis. The nasal star and dentition of this species appear to be primarily adapted to exploit extremely small prey. A report in the journal Nature gives this animal the title of fastest-eating mammal, taking as short as 120 milliseconds (average: 227 ms) to identify and consume individual food items.[7] Its brain decides in approximately 8 ms if a prey is edible or not. This speed is at the limit of the speed of neurons.<br></br>These moles are also able to smell underwater, accomplished by exhaling air bubbles onto objects or scent trails and then inhaling the bubbles to carry scents back through the nose</p>
			<h4>Eastern Mole</h4>
				<img src="https://extension.umd.edu/sites/extension.umd.edu/files/styles/optimized/public/2021-02/hgic_wildlife_mole_1200.jpg?itok=kPTpDkPA" alt="Eastern Mole" style="width:400px; height:400px;">
				<p>The eastern mole or common mole (Scalopus aquaticus) is a medium-sized, overall grey North American mole and the only member of the genus Scalopus. Its large, hairless, spade-shaped forefeet are adapted for digging. The species is native to Canada (Ontario), Mexico, and the eastern United States, and has the widest range of any North American mole.<br></br>The species prefers the loamy soils found in thin woods, fields, pastures, and meadows, and builds both deep and shallow burrows characterized by discarded excess soil collected in molehills. Its nest is composed of leaves and grasses, and its two to five young are on their own at about four weeks. Its diet consists principally of earthworms and other soil life, but the eastern mole will also eat vegetable matter</p>
			<h4>Northern Short-tailed Shrew</h4>
				<img src="https://animalcorner.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/6738152247_cb41988e24_b.jpg" alt="Northern Short-tailed Shrew" style="width:400px; height:400px;">
				<p>The northern short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda) is the largest shrew in the genus Blarina,[3] and occurs in the northeastern region of North America.[4] It is a semifossorial, highly active, and voracious insectivore and is present in a variety of habitats like broadleaved and pine forests among shrubs and hedges as well as grassy river banks.[5] It is notable in that it is one of the few venomous mammals. The specific epithet, brevicauda, is a combination of the Latin brevis and cauda, meaning "short tail"</p>
			<h4>Southeastern Shrew</h4>
				<img src="https://www.outdooralabama.com/sites/default/files/Wildlife/Insectivores/Southeastern%20Shrew.jpg" alt="Southeastern Shrew" style="width:400px; height:400px;">
				<p>The southeastern shrew (Sorex longirostris) is reddish-brown above on its back, head area while the shrew is grayish below in the abdomen area. The shrew's long tail is vaguely bi-colored, with dark and light brown as the color. The southeastern shrew is slightly smaller and more reddish than the masked shrew, which looks very similar to the southeastern shrew. Shrews possess lengthy pointed snouts, tiny eyes and ears. Their hearing and smell are very acute. The tips of the incisor teeth are dark chestnut in color. The pigmentation on the tip of their teeth is caused by deposition of iron in the outer pigmented teeth. It weighs in at 0.11-0.14 ounces and has an approximate total length of 2-4 inches. Their lifespan in the wild is rarely more than a year, but they can live as long as 18 or 19 months.</p>

			<h4>Snowshoe Hare</h4>
				<img src="https://www.maine.gov/ifw/images/snowshoe-hare-winter.jpg" alt="Snowshoe Hare" style="width: 400px; height: 400px;">
				<p>The snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), also called the varying hare or snowshoe rabbit, is a species of hare found in North America. It has the name "snowshoe" because of the large size of its hind feet. The animal's feet prevent it from sinking into the snow when it hops and walks. Its feet also have fur on the soles to protect it from freezing temperatures.<br></br>For camouflage, its fur turns white during the winter and rusty brown during the summer. Its flanks are white year-round. The snowshoe hare is also distinguishable by the black tufts of fur on the edge of its ears. Its ears are shorter than those of most other hares.<br></br>In summer, it feeds on plants such as grass, ferns, and leaves; in winter, it eats twigs, the bark from trees, and plants and, similar to the Arctic hare, has been known to occasionally eat dead animals.[3] It can sometimes be seen feeding in small groups. This animal is mainly active at night and does not hibernate. The snowshoe hare may have up to four litters in a year, which average three to eight young. Males compete for females, and females may breed with several males.</p>
			<h4>Swamp Rabbit</h4>

				<p>The swamp rabbit (Sylvilagus aquaticus), also called the cane-cutter, is a large cottontail rabbit found in the swamps and wetlands of the southern United States. The species has a strong preference for wet areas, and it will take to the water and swim</p>
			<h4>Eastern Cottontail</h4>
				<img src="https://www.reconnectwithnature.org/getmedia/04322096-c66a-49ad-8780-1d51ffeee519/Cottontail-rabbit-Shutterstock.jpg.aspx" alt="Eastern Cottontail" style="width: 400px; height: 400px;">
				<p>The eastern cottontail is chunky, red-brown or gray-brown in appearance, with large hind feet, long ears, and a short, fluffy white tail. Its underside fur is white. There is a rusty patch on the tail. Its appearance differs from that of a hare in that it has a brownish-gray coloring around the head and neck. The body is lighter color with a white underside on the tail. It has large brown eyes and large ears to see and listen for danger. In winter the cottontail's pelage is more gray than brown. The kits develop the same coloring after a few weeks, but they also have a white blaze that goes down their forehead; this marking eventually disappears. This rabbit is medium-sized, measuring 36–48 cm (14–19 in) in total length, including a small tail that averages 5.3 cm (2.1 in).[13][14] Weight can range from 1.8 to 4.4 lb (800 to 2,000 g), with an average of around 2.6 lb (1,200 g). The female tends to be heavier, although the sexes broadly overlap in size.[15][16] There may be some slight variation in the body size of eastern cottontails, with weights seeming to increase from south to north, in accordance with Bergmann's rule. Adult specimens from the Florida Museum of Natural History, collected in Florida, have a mean weight of 2.244 lb (1,018 g).[17] Meanwhile, 346 adult cottontails from Michigan were found to have averaged 3.186 lb (1,445 g) in mass</p>
			<h4>Appalachian Cottontail</h4>
				<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Sylvilagus_obscurus_3.jpg/1200px-Sylvilagus_obscurus_3.jpg" alt="Appalachian Cottontail" style="width: 400px; height: 400px;">
				<p>The Appalachian cottontail, Sylvilagus obscurus, is a small rabbit inhabiting mostly mountainous regions in the eastern U.S. ranging from Pennsylvania to South Carolina and being most prominent in the Appalachians.[2] S. obscurus is better adapted to colder climates than its distant relative, S. floridanus, the eastern cottontail. S. obscurus is light-yellow brown, mixed with black on the dorsal side, having a brown and red patch mixed on the neck. The ventral side is mostly white.[2] The Appalachian cottontail and S. transitionalis, the New England cottontail, are not easily distinguished in the field, and are most easily identified geographically. Cottontails found south or west of the Hudson River are considered Appalachian cottontails, those found north and east are considered New England cottontails. The species can otherwise be identified by chromosome number and skull measurements.[3] Female Appalachian cottontails are typically larger than males with reproductive needs being the most likely cause. The weight of the Appalachian Cottontail can range from as little as 756 grams (1.667 lb) up to as much as 1,153 grams (2.542 lb). The average length is 408 mm (16.1 in). The lifespan of S. obscurus is rather short, less than a year in some cases.</p>

				<p>The northern yellow bat is larger than the southern yellow bat, and has an average body length of 14 cm, weight of 14-31 g, and wing span of 35–41 cm. Its body fur ranges in color from yellow orange to gray-brown, and is dark tipped. Wing membranes are generally darker than the body, and forearms are light. Unusually for Lasiurine bats, only the front half of the tail membrane is furred, and this species also lacks white markings on the shoulders and wrists.</p>
			<h4>Big Brown Bat</h4>
				<img src="https://8867kue5ajzew327ttjgq1a-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/big-brown-bat.jpg" alt="Big Brown Bat" style="width:400px; height:400px;">
				<p>The big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) is a species of vesper bat distributed widely throughout North America, the Caribbean, and the northern portion of South America. It was first described as a species in 1796. Compared to other microbats, the big brown bat is relatively large, weighing 15–26 g (0.53–0.92 oz) and possessing a wingspan of 32.5–35 cm (12.8–13.8 in).<br></br>Big brown bats are insectivorous, consuming a diverse array of insects, particularly night-flying insects, but especially beetles.[4] Some of the beetles it consumes are serious agricultural pests, including cucumber beetles. They are nocturnal, foraging for prey at night and roosting in sheltered areas during the day such as caves, tunnels, tree cavities, and human structures. Their breeding season is in the fall, shortly before their annual hibernation. After hibernation ends in the spring, females form maternity colonies for giving birth to young. Oftentimes only one offspring is produced per litter, though twins are common in the Eastern US. Lifespans of 6.5 years are considered average.</p>
			<h4>Eastern Red Bat</h4>
				<img src="https://nhpbs.org/wild/images/eaternredbatsusanellisforestry.jpg" alt="Eastern Red Bat" style="width:400px; height:400px;">
				<p>The eastern red bat has distinctive fur, with males being brick or rusty red, and females being a slightly more frosted shade of red.[9][10] Both male and female eastern red bats have distinctive shoulder patches of white fur.[10] Individual hairs on its back are approximately 5.8 mm (0.23 in), while hairs on its uropatagium are 2.6 mm (0.10 in) long. Fur on its ventral surface is usually lighter in color. Its entire body is densely furred, including its uropatagium. It is a medium-sized member of its genus, weighing 7–13 g (0.25–0.46 oz) and measuring 109 mm (4.3 in) from head to tail. Its ears are short and rounded, with triangular tragi. Its wings are long and pointed. Its tail is long, at 52.7 mm (2.07 in) long. Its forearm is approximately 40.6 mm (1.60 in) long.</p>
			<h4>Hoary Bat</h4>
				<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Hoary_bat_Lasiurus_cinereus_%28cropped%29.jpg" alt="Hoary Bat" style="width:400px; height:400px;">
				<p>The hoary bat averages 13 to 14.5 cm (5.1 to 5.7 in) long with a 40 cm (15.5 in) wingspan and a weight of 26 g (0.92 oz). It is the largest bat normally found in Canada. Its coat is dense and dark brown, with white tips to the hairs that give the species its 'hoary' appearance for which it is named.[9] The body is covered in fur except for the undersides of the wings. Males and females are dimorphic in body mass, with females 40% heavier than males.</p>
			<h4>Seminole Bat</h4>
				<img src="https://fw.ky.gov/Wildlife/PublishingImages/seminolebatlarge2.jpg" alt="Seminole Bat" style="width:400px; height:400px;">
				<p>The Seminole bat is often confused with the red bat. This is due to the coloring of the Seminole bat, which is a mahogany color with a frosted look due to white tipped dorsal hairs.[4] Coloring is not sexually dimorphic, meaning that males and females are similar in color.[4] Average weight is around 12 grams with females being larger than males.</p>
			<h4>Gray Bat</h4>
				<img src="https://fw.ky.gov/Wildlife/PublishingImages/graybatlarge1.jpg" alt="Gray Bat" style="width:400px; height:400px;">
				<p>The gray bat (Myotis grisescens) is a species of microbat endemic to North America. The creature once flourished in caves all over the southeastern United States, but due to human disturbance, gray bat populations declined severely during the early and mid portion of the 20th century. 95% of gray bats now only roost in 11 caves. M. grisescens has been listed as federally endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service since 1976, and is protected under the Endangered Species Act. Gray bat populations were estimated at approximately 2 million bats around the time they were placed on the Endangered Species list. By the early 1980s populations of gray bats dropped to 1.6 million. With conservation efforts in place, in 2004, gray bat populations were estimated to have reached 3.4 million.</p>
			<h4>Eastern Small-footed Bat</h4>
				<img src="https://fw.ky.gov/Wildlife/PublishingImages/easternsmallfootedmyotislarge3.jpg" alt="Eastern Small-footed Bat" style="width:400px; height:400px;">
				<p>The eastern small-footed bat (Myotis leibii) is a species of vesper bat. It can be found in southern Ontario and Quebec in Canada and in mountainous portions of the eastern United States from New England to northern Georgia, and westward to northern Arkansas.[1] It is among the smallest bats in eastern North America[2] and is known for its small feet and black face-mask. Until recently, all North American small-footed Myotis were considered to be "Myotis leibii". The western population is now considered to be a separate species, Myotis ciliolabrum. The Eastern small-footed bat is rare throughout its range, although the species may be locally abundant where suitable habitat exists.[3] Studies suggest white-nose syndrome has caused declines in their populations.[4][5][6] However, most occurrences of this species have only been counted within the past decade or two and are not revisited regularly, making their population status difficult to assess. Additionally, most bat populations in the Eastern U.S. have been monitored using surveys conducted in caves and mines in the winter, but Eastern small-footed bats hibernate in places that make them unlikely to be encountered during these surveys. Perhaps as a result, the numbers of Eastern small-footed bats counted in winter tend to be low and they are relatively variable compared to other species of bats. Many biologists believe the species is stable, having declined little in recent times, but that it is vulnerable due to its relatively restricted geographic range and habitat needs.</p>
			<h4>Northern Myotis</h4>

				<p>The Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis) is a medium-sized mouse-eared bat native to North America. It lives primarily in Southern and Midwestern U.S. states and is listed as an endangered species. The Indiana bat is gray, black, or chestnut in color and is 1.2–2.0 in long and weighs 4.5–9.5 g (0.16–0.34 oz). It is similar in appearance to the more common little brown bat, but is distinguished by its feet size, toe hair length, pink lips, and a keel on the calcar.<br></br>Indiana bats live in hardwood and hardwood-pine forests. It is common in old-growth forest and in agricultural land, mainly in forest, crop fields, and grasslands. As an insectivore, the bat eats both terrestrial and aquatic flying insects, such as moths, beetles, mosquitoes, and midges.<br></br>The Indiana bat is listed as an endangered species by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. It has had serious population decline, estimated to be more than 50% over the past 10 years, based on direct observation and a decline on its extent of occurrence.[1]</p>

				<p>The North American beaver (Castor canadensis) is one of two extant beaver species, along with the Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber).[22] It is native to North America and introduced in South America (Patagonia) and Europe (primarily Finland and Karelia). In the United States and Canada, the species is often referred to simply as "beaver", though this causes some confusion because another distantly related rodent, Aplodontia rufa, is often called the "mountain beaver". Other vernacular names, including American beaver[22] and Canadian beaver,[27] distinguish this species from the other extant beaver species, Castor fiber, which is native to Eurasia. The North American beaver is one of the official national wildlife of Canada symbols and is the official state mammal of Oregon and New York.</p>

				<p>The oldfield mouse or beach mouse (Peromyscus polionotus) is a nocturnal species of rodent in the family Cricetidae and primarily eats seeds. It lives in holes throughout the southeastern United States in beaches and sandy fields. Predators to these mice include birds and mammals. In 2010, these mice were in the least concern category on the IUCN Red List with certain subspecies classified as extinct or near threatened.</p>
			<h4>Eastern Harvest Mouse</h4>

				<p>The eastern harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys humulis) is a species of rodent in the family Cricetidae. It is endemic to the Southeastern United States. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical seasonally wet or flooded lowland grassland, swamps, and pastureland.</p>
			<h4>Eastern Gray Squirrel</h4>
				<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Eastern_Grey_Squirrel.jpg" alt="Eastern Gray Squirrel" style="width:400px; height:400px;">
				<p>The eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), also known, particularly outside of North America, as simply the grey squirrel, is a tree squirrel in the genus Sciurus. It is native to eastern North America, where it is the most prodigious and ecologically essential natural forest regenerator.[4][5] Widely introduced to certain places around the world, the eastern gray squirrel in Europe, in particular, is regarded as an invasive species.</p>
			<h4>Fox Squirrel</h4>

				<p>The fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), also known as the eastern fox squirrel or Bryant's fox squirrel,[2] is the largest species of tree squirrel native to North America. Despite the differences in size and coloration, it is sometimes mistaken for American red squirrels or eastern gray squirrels in areas where the species co-exist.</p>
			<h4>Hispid Cotton Rat</h4>
				<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Sigmodon_hispidus1.jpg" alt="Hispid Cotton Rat" style="width:400px; height:400px;">
				<p>The hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) is a rodent species long thought to occur in parts of South America, Central America, and southern North America. However, recent taxonomic revisions, based on mitochondrial DNA sequence data, have split this widely distributed species into three separate species (S. hispidus, S. toltecus, and S. hirsutus). The distribution of S. hispidus ranges from Arizona in the west to Virginia to the east and from the Platte River in Nebraska in the north to, likely, the Rio Grande in the south, where it meets the northern edge of the distribution of S. toltecus (formerly S. h. toltecus).[2] Adult size is total length 202–340 mm (8.0–13.4 in); tail 87–122 mm (3.4–4.8 in), frequently broken or stubbed; hind foot 29–35 mm (1.1–1.4 in); ear 16–20 mm (0.63–0.79 in); mass 50–250 g (1.8–8.8 oz).[3] They have been used as laboratory animals.</p>

				<p>The southern bog lemming (Synaptomys cooperi) is a small North American lemming. Its range overlaps with the other species in genus Synaptomys, the northern bog lemming, in southeastern Canada, but extends farther south.</p>
			<h4>Eastern Chipmunk</h4>
				<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Tamias_striatus2.jpg" alt="Eastern Chipmunk" style="width:400px; height:400px;">
				<p>The eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus) is a chipmunk species found in eastern North America. It is the only living member of the chipmunk subgenus Tamias, sometimes recognized as a different genus.[2] The name "chipmunk" comes from the Ojibwe word ᐊᒋᑕᒨ ajidamoo (or possibly ajidamoonh, the same word in the Ottawa dialect of Ojibwe), which translates literally as "one who descends trees headlong."[3] First described by Mark Catesby in his 1743 The Natural History of Carolina, Florida, and the Bahama Islands, the chipmunk was eventually classified as Sciurus striatus by Linnaeus, meaning "striped squirrel" in Latin.[4][5] The scientific name was changed to Tamias striatus, meaning "striped steward," by Johann Illiger in 1811.</p>
			<h4>American Red Squirrel</h4>
				<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Tamiasciurus_hudsonicus_CT.jpg" alt="American Red Squirrel" style="width:400px; height:400px;">
				<p>The American red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) is one of three species of tree squirrels currently classified in the genus Tamiasciurus, known as the pine squirrels (the others are the Douglas squirrel, T. douglasii, and the southwestern red squirrel, T. fremonti). The American red squirrel is variously known as the pine squirrel, North American red squirrel and chickaree. It is also referred to as Hudson's Bay squirrel, as in John James Audubon's work The Viviparous Quadrupeds of North America (hence the species name). The squirrel is a small, 200–250 g (7.1–8.8 oz), diurnal mammal that defends a year-round exclusive territory. It feeds primarily on the seeds of conifer cones, and is widely distributed across North America wherever conifers are common, except on the Pacific coast of the United States, where its cousin, the Douglas squirrel, is found instead.</p>
